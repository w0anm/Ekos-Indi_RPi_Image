Need to add gps packages under "special".
sudo apt install pps-tools gpsd gpsd-clients python-gps chrony

# below not really used.
apt-get install --reinstall ntp gpsd gpsd-clients pps-tools


Adding gps:
 1550  cp syscfg.txt syscfg.txt_20220825
 1551  vi syscfg.txt
 1552  vi /etc/modules
 1553  sudo reboot

# below did not work
systemctl stop serial-getty@ttyS0.service
systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyS0.service

# updated /etc/rc.local file



edit /etc/chrony/chrony.conf

For chrony, add these two lines to the /etc/chrony/chrony.conf file somewhere near the rest of the server lines:

refclock SHM 0 refid NMEA offset 0.200
refclock PPS /dev/pps0 refid PPS lock NMEA



Here is the current file:

<file>
cat /etc/chrony/chrony.conf
# Welcome to the chrony configuration file. See chrony.conf(5) for more
# information about usuable directives.

# This will use (up to):
# - 4 sources from ntp.ubuntu.com which some are ipv6 enabled
# - 2 sources from 2.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org which is ipv6 enabled as well
# - 1 source from [01].ubuntu.pool.ntp.org each (ipv4 only atm)
# This means by default, up to 6 dual-stack and up to 2 additional IPv4-only
# sources will be used.
# At the same time it retains some protection against one of the entries being
# down (compare to just using one of the lines). See (LP: #1754358) for the
# discussion.
#
# About using servers from the NTP Pool Project in general see (LP: #104525).
# Approved by Ubuntu Technical Board on 2011-02-08.
# See http://www.pool.ntp.org/join.html for more information.

# delay determined experimentally by setting noselect then monitoring for a few hours
# 0.325 means the NMEA time sentence arrives 325 milliseconds after the PPS 
# pulse  the delay adjusts it forward

refclock PPS /dev/pps0 refid PPS

# This directive enables kernel synchronisation (every 11 minutes) of the
# real-time clock. Note that it canâ€™t be used along with the 'rtcfile' directive.

# Step the system clock instead of slewing it if the adjustment is larger than
# one second, but only in the first three clock updates.
