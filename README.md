I branched off for the Ubuntu 22.04.1 OS version.  This branch is like the prevous LTS branch.

Installation

Download the zip file found on the main Code page or relase page:  Ekos_Indi_Rpi4_v10_u22_dist.zip
You do not need to download/clone the entire repository, only the distribution zip file located on the main code page or on the v20 Release page.

Once the distribution zip file is downloaded, unzip the file in a temporary location. In the zip file, you will find the documentation on How to download a fresh Raspberry Pi Image and install/deploy the two additional files included in the zip file (scripts.tar and run_first.sh).

The documentation is also found in the main code page.
